# DataScience
The repository features a collection of my best data science projects. Many of them have been completed with Python in Jupyter Notebook. The collection includes examples of webscraping, classification, regression, A/B testing, customer churn, and much more.  https://www.cristel-irwin-data-scientist.com/
